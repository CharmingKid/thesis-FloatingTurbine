__OpenFOAM__ is free, open source software for computational fluid dynamics (CFD),
developed primarily by [CFD Direct](http://cfd.direct), on behalf of the
[OpenFOAM](http://openfoam.org) Foundation.

__turbinesFoam__ is a library for simulating wind and marine hydrokinetic turbines
in OpenFOAM using the actuator line method, developed by [P. Bachant](https://github.com/turbinesFoam/turbinesFoam).

__waves2Foam__  is a toolbox used to generate and absorb free surface water waves based on the relaxation zone method, developed by [Niels G. Jacobsen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319160515_waves2Foam_Manual) and mantained by Deltares.
