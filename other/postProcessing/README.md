Post-processing utilities
============

Basic scripts (MATLAB and Python) for post-processing purposes.

## waves
From the data generated by `waves2Foam`:
- Extraction of surface elevation.
- Error w.r.t. Stokes' second-order theory.
- Calculation of wavelength with the non-linear dispersion relation.

## turbine
From the data generated by `turbinesFoam`:
- Extraction of hub loads.
- Blade distributions:
	- For a given time.
	- Time-averaged.
- Properties at a given radial section.

## ALM_geometry_extractor
Writes a VTK file with the coordinates of the actuator elements so they can be visualized (e.g. in Paraview).

These coordinates are read from the `postProcessing` folder created by `turbinesFoam`.

The `ALgeometry.sh` file must contain the names of the actuator lines of interest. 

The `ALgeometry.sh` file must be run from within the case folder.
